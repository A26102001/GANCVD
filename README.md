# GAN for CVD
Color vision deficiency (CVD) refers to a type of color blindness that affects the ability to perceive specific colors. There exist three different types of color blindness. However, the available datasets for CVD are limited. This project focuses on developing a dataset for CVD and implementing 2-3 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to efficiently recolor images for individuals with color vision deficiency. The optimization process will include recognizing confusing colors, determining suitable replacement colors, and achieving color compensation within an efficient timeframe
